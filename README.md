# Sets / Unions / Intersections / Symetric_Differences
Program written for set building and manipulation, in discrete mathematics.  

This program is designed to allow the user to enter two sets which are stored as the variables, setOne and setTwo seen below. Numbers and characters, along with strings are also allowed to be entered into these lists.

# Notes
To run the program, clone the repository.  Once uploaded, open the project on your computer with your preffered IDE which runs Python.  Select and run the program.  

Characters and strings must be in quotes.  When the user selects to run the program, the lists will be used to find four sets.  Thses sets include:  A normal set, the union of the two sets, the intersection of the two sets, and the symetric difference of the two sets.  The results will be labeled and displayed to the screen for the user to see. """
